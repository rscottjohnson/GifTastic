# GifTastic
### A dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice.

#### 05/26/18 - Scott Johnson

## Project Goal
GifTastic demonstrates the use of the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page, which populates with gifs of the user's choosing.  The user can click on any of the predefined buttons on the page to make a call to the GIPHY API.  JavaScript and jQuery are then used to change the HTML of the site.

## Project Usefulness
This project incorporates jQuery learnings on how to correctly select and manipulate HTML elements within the DOM.  API usage is explored, which requires setting query parameters in order to get the appropriate response from the API.  This API call is performed using the AJAX GET method, and the data from the response is used throughout the site.

## Help, Support, and Maintenance
